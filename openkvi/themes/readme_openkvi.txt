This 'themes' folder must be copied in the wavemaker common folder.

If the wavemaker working folder (set in the studio preferences) is /root/WaveMaker, the directory tree must look like this:
- the project is located in /root/WaveMaker/projects/openkvi/
- the theme in /root/WaveMaker/common/themes/blSimple01/


When the theme is modified, it must be copied in the SVN folder in order to commit changes.
