<dl><dt><code>default:</code></dt><dd>This mode makes it so that a persistent guest will see the same hardware no matter what host the guest is booted on. This is the default when no mode attribute is specified.</dd>
<dl><dt><code>host-model:</code></dt><dd>The host-model mode is essentially a shortcut to copying host CPU definition as seen by Libvirt into the domain. Libvirt does not model every aspect of each CPU so the guest CPU will not match the host CPU exactly. On the other hand, the ABI provided to the guest is reproducible. During migration, complete CPU model definition is transferred to the destination host so the migrated guest will see exactly the same CPU model even if the destination host contains more capable CPUs for the running instance of the guest; but shutting down and restarting the guest may present different hardware to the guest according to the capabilities of the new host.</i> Beware, due to the way libvirt detects host CPU and due to the fact libvirt does not talk to QEMU/KVM when creating the CPU model, CPU configuration created using host-model may not work as expected. The guest CPU may differ from the configuration and it may also confuse guest OS by using a combination of CPU features and other parameters (such as CPUID level) that don't work.</i></dd>
<dl><dt><code>host-passthrough:</code></dt><dd>With this mode, the CPU visible to the guest should be exactly the same as the host CPU even in the aspects that libvirt does not understand. Though the downside of this mode is that the guest environment cannot be reproduced on different hardware.</dd>
